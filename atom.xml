    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting a blog is something I wanted to do for a few years now, but I worried too much about not having enough time or things to write about, so I always put it off.</p>

<p>But this weekend I had some free time on my hands and found myself googling around for blogging platforms. After some clicking around, I ran into Jekyll and was instantly intrigued by it. And now I&rsquo;m sitting here typing up this post.</p>

<p>I want to mention that since this is my first time venturing into the land of blogging, I want to apologize in advance if I make any rookie mistakes. Feel free to laugh and point it out. I will have a good laugh myself and hopefully learn from it.</p>

<p>My main goal with this blog is to share my web development knowledge. I plan on covering the side projects I work on and the technologies that power them. As an aspiring web developer, I heavily rely on other people&rsquo;s blogs to get stuff done, so I want to give back to the community and hopefully be of similar help to other aspiring web developers.</p>

<p>In my next post I&rsquo;ll be talking about a side project I&rsquo;ve been working on for quite a while now. It&rsquo;s already online and you can check it out at <a href="http://www.phindee.com">phindee.com</a>.</p>

<p>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</p>
