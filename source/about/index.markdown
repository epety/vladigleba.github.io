Hello, my name is Vladi Gleba, and I'm a web developer.

It all started in a 10th grade web design class. I had never seen HTML source code prior to it, and when the class was over, I knew web development was what I wanted to pursue.

Throughout high school, I continued learning web development on the side, and once college came around, I decided to study computer science since it was the closest thing to web development I could find.

Computer science expanded my horizons and introduced me to many new things, but apart from internships, my exposure to the web was limited. But now that I'm out of college, I'll be pursuing web development full-time.

I plan on using this blog as a means of documenting my journey, and you're welcome to [follow along](http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=927939&cids=1), if you'd like. My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vladigleba), my work history is on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vladigleba), and everything else is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vladigleba). And if you'd like to say hello, you're more than welcome to do so at <hi@vladigleba.com>.
