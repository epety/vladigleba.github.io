"what do you want to be when you grow up?" We hear it all the time as kids, and it tends to increases in frequency and urgency as we grow up. We all have different criteria for answering it; some care about the money and prestige, while others care about their passion. It's a hard question to answer, and even when you think you have it figured out, it's not common to change your mind at least once, if not multiple times.

I went through this struggle myself. Up until tenth grade, I thought I wanted to be an electrical engineer specializing in robotics, but once I took an electronics class, that dream quickly faded away. Although I enjoyed designing circuits, soldering them was a little too "hands-on" for me. I also had a long fling with filmmaking.  Being able to tell a story through a series of carefully crafted shots was magical to me, but the tediousness of editing turned me off. I would spent countless hours experimenting and trying to figure out the perfect way to cut a scene, and this perfectionism made the editing process extremely exhausting. And it was only recently that I finally let go of my dreams of becoming a professional designer, and it was largely for the same reasons as filmmaking. I walk away from all this realizing that having deep respect and admiration for something doesn't necessarily mean it's your calling.

I consider myself a web developer now, and I do believe it's my calling, because not only do I admire the coding process, I'm also wired for it in many ways. It satisfies my need for design, creativity, and problem solving. It gives me the right amount of human interaction that I'm not exhausted by it. It keeps my perfectionism dormant because there is nothing to tweak or fine-tune. And finally, it allows me to make a difference and impact people's lives in a positive way (some might not agree with this part), which is absolutely paramount for me, because if no one is blessed by my work, what's the point?

I was lucky to find web development early.

Do I believe web development will be my calling ten years from now? Who knows? I might discover something I never tried before and immediately fall in love with it. My interests and values can change as well, and they might or might not align with web development. It's an unnerving thought, because it won't be easy to change my career path ten years from now. Unless I manage to keep my standard of living the same as it is now (highly unlikely), I'll have increased financial commitments, not to mention possible family commitments as well.
