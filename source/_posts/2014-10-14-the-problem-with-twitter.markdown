I first created a Twitter account two years ago, and it lasted for about two months. Last month I decided to give it another try. It seems like everyone working in the web or creative industry is on Twitter, and I felt like I was missing out on a chance to meet them by not being on Twitter. But this time I lasted only a month. I quit for the same reason as the first time: I didn't like what Twitter did to me and how it affected my brain. Why should I let Twitter rewire the synapses in my brain to fit its way of doing things. Shouldn't it rewire itself to fit with the way the human brain works? (Note: I don't have scientific evidence to prove any of my points below, but I do have personal experience, and I suspect I'm not the only experiencing these things.)

# It's Overwhelming

Twitter is a fire hose of constant, unrelated, small bits of information, a majority of which are highly irrelevant to what I want to think or talk about at a given moment. It gives me a temporary high while I'm at it, but when I'm done, I'm left feeling frazzled and disjointed, as if my brain just received a plethora of tiny electric shocks.

And Twitter only inflates this problem by always recommending more people to follow, while never telling me about those I don't engage with and should unfollow. Those behind Twitter don't seem to understand that the more people I follow, the more likely I am to miss the tweets of those I care about. Their goal for me is to follow more people, so I can interact more and stay on the site longer. But is this really the best way to keep me around?

# It's Disruptive

Twitter is outsourced schizophrenia, as [one user put it](http://adambrault.com/2012/12/04/i-quit-twitter-for-a-month-and-it-completely-changed-my). He says, "I have a couple hundred voices I have consensually agreed to allow residence inside my brain. ... Twitter has made me break up my thoughts into tiny, incomplete, pieces&dash;lots of hanging ideas, lots of incomplete relationships, punctuated by all manner of hanging threads and half-forked paths." The problem with this is it then takes a concerted effort to keep my mind from drifting when it's time to be productive and get things done. I constantly find myself fighting the urge to check things while trying to remain focused on the task at hand. And I don't like it. Twitter takes my brain to such an excited state that anything requiring focus, contemplation, or reflection becomes nearly impossible to do after logging off. Once this happens, it can take a long time for me to be able to regain my mental "calmness" and the ability to focus. But there is more.

Paul Graham wrote [an article](http://paulgraham.com/top.html) in which he explains how giving our brain the ability to freely "drift" is beneficial to creativity and problem solving (I highly recommend you read it). Our thoughts freely drift when we're doing something on "autopilot," like taking a shower or driving along a familiar route. This also happen when we're not doing anything in particular, like when we're "daydreaming." These are the times when some of our best thinking happens and moments of insight occur, but the problem is this is happening less and less, because our phones are always close by to alleviate our boredom and keep us entertained. During my month-long stint with Twitter, for example, I would usually pull my phone out and start scrolling through my Twitter feed whenever I had a spare minute. And I doubt I'm the only one that experiences this.

But even if you let your thought freely drift, you can't directly control where your thoughts go, because if you are, they're not really drifting freely. But you *can* control them *indirectly* by being conscious of and selective about the things that deserve space in your mind. I find that Twitter increases the amount of "noise" in my brain, and my thoughts have more things to freely drift to, as a result. The things my thoughts freely drift to are the things that will benefit from insight and creative problem solving, while others are starved of it. If those are not the thoughts that should be starved, well, then there is work to do.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's wise to expose yourself to a limited number of ideas. What I'm talking about is the involuntary intrusion of unrelated and irrelevant thoughts that Twitter creates, which results in distraction from the things that matter. Of course, there is a time for everything, including a time to be distracted, but I found myself distracted with Twitter more often than I would've liked.

# It's Addictive

Twitter is a drug that's designed to keep you on the site as long as possible and to keep you coming back as often as possible.

Twitter moves so fast that if I'm not continuously checking in, I miss out on the conversations. thus there's always a pressure to check Twitter now. Plus, if you Tweet occasionally, itâ€™s easy for people to forget all about you.
