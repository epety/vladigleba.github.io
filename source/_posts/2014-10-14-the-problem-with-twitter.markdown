I first created a Twitter account two years ago, and it lasted for about two months. Last month I decided to give it another try. It seems like everyone working in the web or creative industry is on Twitter, and I felt like I was missing out on a chance to meet them by not being on Twitter. But this time I lasted only a month. I quit for the same reason as the first time: the way Twitter works is incompatible with the way my brain works. And I suspect it's not just my brain, but most people's brain as well. I don't want to rewire the synapses in my brain to fit Twitter's way of doing things; Twitter should rewire itself to fit with the way the human brain works.

# It's Overwhelming

Twitter is a fire hose of constant, unrelated, small bits of information, a majority of which are highly irrelevant to what I want to think or talk about at a given moment. It gives me a temporary high while I'm at it, but when I'm done, I'm left feeling frazzled and disjointed, as if my brain just received a plethora of tiny electric shocks.

And Twitter only inflates this problem by always recommending more people to follow, while never telling me about those I don't engage with and should unfollow. Those behind Twitter don't seem to understand that the more people I follow, the more likely I am to miss the tweets of those I care about. Their goal for me is to follow more people, so I can interact more and stay on the site longer. But is this really the best way to keep me around?

# It's Disruptive

Twitter is outsourced schizophrenia, as [one user put it](http://adambrault.com/2012/12/04/i-quit-twitter-for-a-month-and-it-completely-changed-my). He says, "I have a couple hundred voices I have consensually agreed to allow residence inside my brain. ... Twitter has made me break up my thoughts into tiny, incomplete, pieces&dash;lots of hanging ideas, lots of incomplete relationships, punctuated by all manner of hanging threads and half-forked paths." The problem with this is it then takes a concerted effort to keep my mind from drifting when it's time to be productive and get things done. I constantly find myself fighting the urge to check things while trying to remain focused on the task at hand. And I don't like it. Twitter takes my brain to such an excited state that anything requiring focus, contemplation, or reflection becomes nearly impossible to do after logging off. Once this happens, it can take a long time for me to be able to regain my mental "calmness" and the ability to focus. But there is more.

Paul Graham wrote [an article](http://paulgraham.com/top.html) in which he explains how giving our brain the ability to freely "drift" is beneficial to creativity and problem solving (I highly recommend you read it). Our thoughts freely drift when we're doing something on "autopilot," like taking a shower or driving along a familiar route. This also happen when we're not doing anything in particular, like when we're "daydreaming." These are the times when some of our best thinking happens, but the problem is this is happening less and less, because our phones are always close by to alleviate our boredom and keep us entertained. During my month-long stint with Twitter, for example, I would usually pull out my phone and start scrolling through my Twitter feed whenever I had a spare minute. And I suspect I'm not the only one  that experiences this.
