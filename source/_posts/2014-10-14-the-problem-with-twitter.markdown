I first created a Twitter account two years ago, and it lasted for about two months. Last month I decided to give it another try. It seems like everyone working in the web or creative industry is on Twitter, and I felt like I was missing out on a chance to meet them by not being on Twitter. But this time I didn't even last two months. I quit for the same reason as the first time: I didn't like what Twitter did to me and how it affected my brain. Why should I let Twitter rewire the synapses in my brain to fit its way of doing things? Shouldn't it rewire itself to fit with the way the human brain works? (Note: I don't have scientific evidence to prove any of my points below, but I do have personal experience, and I suspect I'm not the only one.)

# It Overwhelms You

Twitter is a fire hose of constant, unrelated, small bits of information, a majority of which are highly irrelevant to what I want to think or talk about at a given moment. It gives me a temporary high while I'm at it, but when I'm done, I'm left feeling frazzled and disjointed, as if my brain just received a plethora of tiny, little electric shocks.

And Twitter only inflates this problem by always recommending more people to follow, while never telling me about those I don't engage with and should unfollow. Those behind Twitter don't seem to understand that the more people I follow, the more likely I am to miss the tweets of those I care about. Their goal for me is to follow more people, so I can interact more and stay on the site longer.

Then there's the pressure to always check Twitter because you don't want to miss out on any interesting conversations. And there's also the need to always tweet, because if you don't, it's easy for your followers to forget all about you since there are countless others who *are* tweeting. But is all this vying for a few seconds of people's attention worth it? It's not a secret that humans are not capable of empathizing with hundreds of people, yet we still see everyone's pain, problems, and bad days on a daily basis. Are we building up a calloused, jaded, or cynical defense against all this, as a result? Is this healthy?

# It Disrupts Your Thinking

Twitter is "outsourced schizophrenia," as [one user put it](http://adambrault.com/2012/12/04/i-quit-twitter-for-a-month-and-it-completely-changed-my). He says, "I have a couple hundred voices I have consensually agreed to allow residence inside my brain. ... Twitter has made me break up my thoughts into tiny, incomplete, pieces&dash;lots of hanging ideas, lots of incomplete relationships, punctuated by all manner of hanging threads and half-forked paths." The problem with this is it then takes a concerted effort to keep my mind from drifting when it's time to be productive and get things done. I constantly find myself fighting the urge to check things while trying to remain focused on the task at hand. And I don't like it. Twitter takes my brain to a certain state of excitement that makes anything requiring focus, contemplation, or reflection becomes nearly impossible to do after logging off. Once this happens, it can take a long time for me to be able to regain my mental "calmness" and the ability to focus.

Paul Graham wrote [an article](http://paulgraham.com/top.html) in which he explains how giving our brain the ability to freely "drift" is beneficial to creativity and problem solving (I highly recommend the entire article). Our thoughts freely drift when we're doing something on "autopilot," like taking a shower or driving along a familiar route. This also happen when we're not doing anything in particular, like when we're "daydreaming." These are the times when some of our best thinking happens and moments of insight occur, but the problem is this is happening less and less, because our phones are always close by to alleviate our boredom and keep us entertained. During my month-long stint with Twitter, for example, I would usually pull my phone out and start scrolling through my Twitter feed whenever I had a spare minute. And I doubt I'm the only one that experiences this.

But even if you let your thought freely drift, you can't directly control where your thoughts go, because if you are, they're not really drifting freely. But you *can* control them *indirectly* by being conscious of and selective about the things that deserve space in your mind. I find that Twitter increases the amount of "noise" in my brain, and my thoughts have more things to freely drift to, as a result. The things my thoughts freely drift to are the things that will benefit from insight and creative problem solving, while others are starved of it. What if those are not the thoughts that should be starved?

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's wise to expose yourself to a limited number of ideas. What I'm talking about is the involuntary intrusion of unrelated and irrelevant thoughts that Twitter creates, which results in distraction from the things that matter. Of course, there is a time for everything, including a time to be distracted, but I want my "distraction" time to be more focused and less random.

# It Removes You from Reality

We live in a unique time in human history, a time in which the real and the virtual are striving to coexist, and both are competing for our time and attention. The thing is it's hard to participate in both worlds at the same time. When we're staring down at our phones, we're not looking at the people and the world around us. It's tempting to think we can multitask and effortlessly switch between the two, but that often results in us not being fully present in neither one.  
Personally, I would rather enjoy my meal rather than tweet about its taste, the indie band playing in the background, or the creepy dude sitting in the corner. I would rather be fully immersed in a conversation with real, live humans rather than being preoccupied with responding to all the replies to the tweets above.

Social media makes it possible for anyone to be social, but are we truly social when we're typing away at our phones while ignoring the real, live humans next to us who don't have an avatar next to their name?

# It Makes You More Narcissistic

In a series of experiments, the researchers found that the act of disclosing information about oneself activates the same sensation of pleasure in the brain that we get from eating food, getting money or having sex. It's all a matter of degrees of course, (talking about yourself isn't quite as pleasurable as sex for most of us), but the science makes it clear that our brain considers self-disclosure to be a rewarding experience. This may help explain recent surveys of Internet use that show that roughly 80% of posts to social media sites like Twitter and Facebook consist simply of announcements about one's own immediate experience.

# Parting Thoughts

Are the new technologies overtaking us may be eroding characteristics that are essentially human: our ability to reflect, genuine empathy, a sense of community connected by something deeper than snark or political affinity. Is Twitter chatter displacing real rapport and real conversation? (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/magazine/the-twitter-trap.html?_r=0)
